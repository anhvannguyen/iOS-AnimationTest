iOS-Animation
==================
This project was made to see how to see how to put a group of different animation together to make a single almost seamless animation.  The purpose is to try to generate a custom attack sequence.  This is done with the Cocos2d 2 framework in Objective-C.

In the future, this will be done for iOS 8 using the new Cocos2d 3 or SpriteBuilder
